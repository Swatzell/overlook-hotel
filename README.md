##Abstract:
The goal of this project was to create a hotel booking site where a customer can login and see what they have booked,how much they've spent and book another room. We did all this using API calls for data for fetching and pushing.

##Goals and Objectives:
Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
Create a clear and accessible user interface
Make network requests to retrieve data
Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
Write DRY, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)

##Wins + Challenges:
Learning new techniques like regular expressions and using iterators with innerHtml was a major win for me.
A big challenge was making TDD work properly with mock data.
A win and a challenge was making the entered date be in the proper format for the API data.
